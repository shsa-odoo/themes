    <!--
    This XML file is used to generate primary snippet templates for the 'theme_space' module in Odoo.

    The file contains an Odoo function call that triggers the generation of primary snippet templates
    which are not predefined. This is done by invoking the '_generate_primary_snippet_templates' method
    on the 'ir.module.module' model.

    Elements:
        - <function>: Calls a method on a specified model.
            - model: The model on which the method is called ('ir.module.module').
            - name: The name of the method to be called ('_generate_primary_snippet_templates').
            - <value>: Contains the arguments passed to the method.
                - eval: Evaluates the expression to get the reference to the 'theme_space' module.
                    - ref('base.module_theme_space'): References the 'theme_space' module to generate the primary snippet templates for it.

    Usage:
        This file should be included in the module's data files to ensure that the primary snippet templates
        are generated when the module is installed or updated.

        <value eval="[ref('base.module_theme_space')]"/>
