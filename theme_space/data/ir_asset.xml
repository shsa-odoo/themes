    <!--
    This XML file is used to define an asset record for the 'theme_space' module in Odoo. The asset record
    specifies the primary SCSS variables that are used throughout the theme.

    Elements:
        - <record>: Defines a new record in the 'theme.ir.asset' model.
            - id: The unique identifier for this asset record ('theme_space.primary_variables_scss').
            - model: The model in which the record is created ('theme.ir.asset').

        - <field>: Specifies the fields for the asset record.
            - name="key": The unique key for the asset ('theme_space.primary_variables_scss').
            - name="name": A human-readable name for the asset ('Primary variables SCSS').
            - name="bundle": The asset bundle to which this asset belongs ('web._assets_primary_variables').
            - name="path": The file path to the SCSS file containing the primary variables ('theme_space/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss').

    Usage:
        This file should be included in the module's data files to ensure that the primary SCSS variables
        are properly loaded and available for use in the theme. This helps in maintaining consistent styling
        across the theme by centralizing the primary variables in one SCSS file.
